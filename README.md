Simple example of how to use MyBatis with annotations.

This example uses an embedded H2 database by default.  This allows you to check the project out and immediately
run a clean build via Maven:

``mvn clean verify
``

In addition, a MySQL Workbench file is included, along with a sample MyBatis generator file.  You can use these
to explore more complex mappings - for example, to use the generator with an existing schema.

## Requirements

- [Maven 3.1.0](http://maven.apache.org/)
- Java 1.7+
